# Introduction

In the banking industry, managing customer relationships involves two critical types of costs: Acquisition Costs and Retention Costs. Acquisition Costs refer to the expenses incurred to attract and onboard new customers. On the other hand, Retention Costs are associated with efforts to maintain and engage existing customers.

Predicting customer behavior accurately can be challenging, and human limitations often lead to incorrect predictions about customer churn and retention. This misalignment in predicting customer behavior can result in inefficient allocation of resources and increased costs.

Furthermore, it is well-established that the cost of acquiring a new customer is approximately ten times higher than the cost of retaining an existing one. Consequently, if we incorrectly predict a customer as retained when they actually churn, we end up spending more than necessary.

## What To Do

In this project, I aim to develop a machine learning model to forecast which customers are likely to leave the bank or remain loyal.

## Goal

The model will identify which customers are likely to leave or stay, allowing for precise allocation of resources.

## Value

Minimized Acquisition Cost.

## Dataset

The dataset that I will use is from Kaggle.com. You may visit the dataset through this [link]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn)).

This dataset contains 18 variables (columns) and 10000 observations (rows).
